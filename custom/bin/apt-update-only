# (because of how simple it is, and the singular invocation is "safe enough" by Jake's standards)
# Additionally, this script... doesn't work without sudo.
# So instead of obviously failing, we'll re-invoke ourself with sudo
# Security issues - I don't know how safe "sudo $0"

else

  # Warning: $0 is tempting, but capable of failure. see https://stackoverflow.com/a/31872769/285944
  # This script lives in a known directory, so we invoke ourselves by our own known full path
