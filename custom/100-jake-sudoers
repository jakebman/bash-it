# This file MUST be edited with the 'visudo' command as root.
#
# You should add this file as local content in /etc/sudoers.d/
# The file should be readable only by root and the root group
# It should not be writable (that's what visudo is for!)
#
# See the man page for details on how to write a sudoers file.
